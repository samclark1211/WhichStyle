# WhichStyle

Style guide created to generate static pages from yaml files.

Running locally the instructions are simple

*Go into the directory
* `Ç¹pm start`
* Naviagate to the provided URL

For now we will have to manually update iht.css and the other front end assets which are taken from assets_frontend

To add a new style you just have to navigate to /create
Fill the form in with your html and away you go.

The yaml creation is a little flakey so you may need to introduce your own indentations before you finish.

The addition of new styles is simple, just add your changes, commit them and then push to heroku.
